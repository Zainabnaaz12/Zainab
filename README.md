# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical parameters using various machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

Early diagnosis of diabetes can help in better management and treatment. In this project, i have used supervised machine learning techniques to build a model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using data like glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the *Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Features Used

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)


## Results

Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model was Random Forest with an accuracy of 75%.

## How to Run
